# Petrov-Galerkin Stability analysis for Higher Peclet Numbers

• Finite Element method for Convection diffusion was formulated using Standard Galerkin, where we observed the generation of weaker diagonal for Advection term. This produced significant instability for Convection dominated problems.

• As a part of treatment for instability, we introduced artificial diffusion by introducing Petrov-Galerkin Method where an additional weight which was indeed a derivative quantity and added to the Advection, which played crucial role in bringing back the stability for advection domination problem.

• Further research was performed on the relaxation function α, where we observed there exists both a critical and an optimal value for the stabilized solution and observed that Optimal value of α performs exactly to Analytical Solution

• Grid Independence was tested for Petrov-Galerkin method and for a velocity of 25m/s, grid independence was attained for nearly 150 Nodes..
