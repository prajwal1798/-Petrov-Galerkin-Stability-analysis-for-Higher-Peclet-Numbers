# -Petrov-Galerkin-Stability-analysis-for-Higher-Peclet-Numbers
Finite Element Method for convection-diffusion was formulated using Standard Galerkin, showing instability for convection-dominated problems due to a weaker Advection term. Using Petrov-Galerkin, we added artificial diffusion for stability. Research on the relaxation function found optimal values matching analytical solutions.
